## About the documentation
At this stage of the selection process we want the decisions behind the code, so it is essential that the README has some information that understands your solution.


## Some hints of what we expect to see are:
Basic instructions on how to run the project;
Details about your solution, we would like to know what was your rationale in the decisions;
In case something is not clear and you need to recognize some premise, which means it motivated you to make decisions.
